Summary of findings:
-	Casual riders use Cyclisticâ€™s bike less often while they ride longer duration compared to the members
-	Casual riders use docked bike while member do not use them
-	Casual riders have less usage in the morning versus members
-	Riders end their trip closer to Michigan Lake shore line
-	There are higher usage during the weekend

Recommendations

- Since riders travel to tourist destinations around the shore line, promoting benefits and perks for member riders could encourage casual riders to apply for membership. Note that it can be more effective for local customers.
- The campaign should be launch for the afternoon rides and in May through October as the usage depends on weather conditions
- Next steps could be further analysis on current member demographic information. We could expect to see some trend within member group. Then, a strategy how to convert casual riders with similar profile to the members to apply for membership.
- Further analysis in casual riders: may require more information to differentiate between local riders and tourists, leading to more specific marketing campaign.
